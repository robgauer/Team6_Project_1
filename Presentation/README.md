# Story
COVID-19:  How does the state of Minnesota compare?

# Comparitive Analysis
Looking to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the state of Minnesota based on the following criteria: Total Population, Testing, Hospitalization, and Death Rate.

   * Minnesota versus National.
   * Minnesota versus a similar size state population.
   * Minnesota population center density versus another states similar population center. To be defined as a comparitive city/county versus similar population state city/county. We have chosen Hennepin and Ramsey counties which contain the cities of Minneapolis and St.Paul.

# Data Sources
   * The COVID Tracking Project. Import national and state historical data related 
        to the United States population summary information for national and state(s) 
        COVID-19 testing, hospitalization, and death rates.
        https://covidtracking.com/data

   * Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. Import current data for counties comparitive
        analysis of COVID Tracking Project data. Focus on a sample population comparison 
        for a area of similar counties population density. Exmaple: MN Hennepin & Ramsey.

   *  United States Census Bureau. Import state and county population data for sizing 
        comparision of national, state, and county COVID-19 analysis using 2018 estimates.

# Project Requirements
Development Technical Requirements:
* Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the ﬁnal data analysis. 
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
* (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can ﬁnd an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
* Create a write-up summarizing your major ﬁndings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your ﬁndings and any relevant plots.
* SUMMARY WRITE UP:  Team6ProjectPY-Summary.ipynb
  Link: https://github.com/robgauer/Team6_Project_1/blob/master/Team6ProjectPY-Summary.ipynb 

Presentation Requirements:
* Prepare a formal ten-minute presentation that presents:
* Questions found interesting and what motivated you to investigate and answer them?
* Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions?
* The data exploration and clean up process accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook.
* The analysis process accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook.
* Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary.
* The implications of your findings? What do your findings mean?
